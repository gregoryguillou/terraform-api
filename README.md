# Lineup

Think about `Lineup` as `your terraform project managed by a server`. You
would use it from a command line or from a REST API. It can be used:

- to create and destroy environments on-demand.
- to update environments on-demand from a git branch/tag
- to build a frontend applications or a chatbot
- to **reduce cost** by managing systematic destroy or a time lease
- to build temporary infrastructure for demonstration, training or create
  manage SaaS environment
- to do whatever you can think of...
