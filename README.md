# Terraform API

![Terraform API](https://api.travis-ci.org/gregoryguillou/terraform-api.svg?branch=master)

`Terraform API` helps you manage Terraform projects and workspaces from the
Cloud. Access them securely from a command line or via a REST API. You should be
able to use Terraform from anywhere and:

- Create and destroy development, training or demonstration environments 
  on-demand.
- Update environments on-demand from a git branch/tag
- Add and create environments, any time, from a scheduler and keep your
  stacks clean and lean
- Build temporary infrastructure for demonstration and training
- Publish SaaS applications to your customers
- Integrate other tools and be creative...

## Short demo

The Youtube video below shows an example of what can be done with this API. It
relies on Slack and Hubot to apply/destroy a Terraform project:
