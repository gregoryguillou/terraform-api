# Lineup

Think about `Lineup` as `your Terraform project managed by a server` or, as we
like to see it, `Terraform power to the mass`. If you work with a Cloud
provider or as an Ops, you might already have experienced the power of
Terraform. You know how easy it is to build and modify change environments.
`Lineup` provide an easy access to this work from a Command Line or via a
REST API. Anybody you have granted the right to can access and benefit from
your work. `Lineup` allows you to:

- Create and destroy development, training or demonstration environments on-demand.
- Update environments on-demand from a git branch/tag
- Build a frontend applications or a chatbot
- **reduce cost** by managing systematic destroy or a time lease
- Build temporary infrastructure for demonstration, training or create manage
  SaaS environment
- Do whatever you can think of...
