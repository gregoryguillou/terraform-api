# Terraform-deck

`Terraform-deck` relies on containers to manage a set of terraform projects and 
workspaces. Access it securely from a Command Line Interface or via the REST
API, and:

- Create and destroy development, training or demonstration environments 
  on-demand.
- Update environments on-demand from a git branch/tag
- Build frontend applications and chatbots
- **Reduce cost** by managing systematic destruction and time lease
- Build temporary infrastructure for demonstration, training and manage your
  SaaS environments
- Be creative...
