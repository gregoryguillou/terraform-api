## Better deployment model

This change has several objectives:

- [ ] Deploy a docker-compose stack that is self-content (no need to build) and
  can be used to demonstrate or kick start a `terrorm-deck` deployment
- [ ] Create/Publish an AMI so that we can kick off the docker-compose in minutes
  in a Cloud environment
- [ ] Create a Terraform Deployment that registers the service in an ALB and
  handle an URL
- [ ] Modify the documentation accordingly
