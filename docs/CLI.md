# Command Line Interface

`Lineup` provides a command line interface written with go to interact with the
API. To know more about it, run one of the commands below

```shell
lineup help
lineup <command> help
```

> **Note:** For obvious reasons, Lineup requires you connect to the API. In order
  to to that you must have an API key as well as the API endpoint. Assuming you
  want to store those informations in the $HOME/.lineup directory, you can run
  `lineup configure` to do it.
